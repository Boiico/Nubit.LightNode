```

ℹ️ #Whether you are launching the light node for the first time or are an existing user, this single command will automatically upgrade to the latest version of nubit-node and initiate the light node, regardless of the directory you are in. You will immediately benefit from a more resource-efficient way to participate in the Bitcoin network while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

# ✳️ Windows :

ℹ️ #Nubit’s light node currently supports only Linux and Mac. To participate using Windows, please install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and follow the Linux instructions.

✅  Step 1 📍 (Installing WSL on Windows)

ℹ️ #Open Windows PowerShell and run

```
wsl --install --no-distribution
```
ℹ️ #This process may take a while, and you will need to restart your computer when it's done.

✅  Step 2 📍 (Choose Available Linux distributions)

```
wsl --list --online
```

ℹ️ #Install Ubuntu (recommended for this guide) by running:

```
wsl --install ubuntu
```

ℹ️ #You will be prompted to set a username and password for your new Ubuntu installation.

✅  Step 2 📍 (Running The LightNode)

ℹ️ #To start your light node, simply run the following command:
